From OG Author of template

Change the data in the data.json file as well as add any images to public/img/ You can also change styles by modifying the public/css files. 

If you need the contact form to work, you also need to create an EmailJS account, and modify the src/components/contact.jsx file to replace your own service ID, template ID and Public Key
